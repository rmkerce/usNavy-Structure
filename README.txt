# usNavy-Structure
This structure was the first assignment I really enjoyed assembling in C. I felt like everything I had learned up to this point culminated into this project.
The end result was a console, menu-driven program I really enjoyed interacting with. And it works very well. There may be bugs still in the system,
no doubt, any changes that could be made, feel free to add them.

This assignment was made for an Introduction to Programming in C class in Spring 2015. It was our last assignment for the semester and I received
an A on it.
